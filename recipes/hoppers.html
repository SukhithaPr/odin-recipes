    <p>Sri Lankan Hoppers recipe that uses long 18-20 hour fermentation to get the authentic Hopper taste. The ultimate
        Sri Lankan street food that everyone loves. I’ve never met a person who doesn’t like these crispy
        coconutty Sri Lankan hoppers. I have no idea why these are called Hoppers. Maybe because these are too good that
        you would jump for joy when you taste. lol. I don’t know.. But all I can tell you is that these crispy tangy
        coconutty goodies are so amazing, I’m sure you’re going to fall in love with these just as I have.</p>
    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200 g Rice flour</li>
        <li>1 pinch of yeast</li>
        <li>3⁄4 cup water (175mg)</li>
        <li>200 ml of coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>salt as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The night before you make hoppers (18hrs - 20hrs earlier) make a very thigh dough-like paste using rice
            flour, yeast, and water. You can use a spoon or fork to mix this. Then cover with and let it ferment for 18
            to 20 hours. It's okay to make them a little earlier or a little later. Do NOT add sugar or salt.</li>
        <li>18 to 20 hours later you should be able to notice that there are some bubbles on the surface and the paste
            has risen a little bit.</li>
        <li>After 18 - 20 hours add sugar and coconut milk and make a somewhat thick batter. Not too thick or not too
            thin. Careful when you add coconut milk. You might need less or more than 200ml. So add a little by little
            and see the consistency is right. Do NOT add salt yet. Now cover again and let it sit for 30 mins.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add a generous amount of oil to your hopper pan. Let the oil heat a bit and then add an egg yolk
            if your pan is too sticky. ( Or you can use the whole egg if your pan is old and well seasoned) break the
            egg yolk in the oil as it frying and rub it all in the pan using your spoon. Then remove the oil and the egg
            yolk to a heatproof bowl. We are going to use this oil to rub the pan before making each hopper. **Skip this
            step completely if you're using a nonstick hopper pan.</li>
        <li>After 30 mins of mixing coconut milk and sugar, add salt to the batter and mix very well.</li>
        <li>Heat the hopper pan on medium heat, add a ladle full of batter to the center. and swirl the pan around to
            coat the inside with the batter. Now cover the pan and let it cook for about 45 seconds or until it's done.
        </li>
        <li>And swirl the pan around to coat the inside with the batter. Now cover the pan. Do not open the lid again
            and again.</li>
        <li>Let it cook for about 45 seconds or until it's done.</li>
        <li>For egg hoppers, pour the batter ( a little less than plain hoppers), break an egg in, add salt and pepper,
            cover, and cook on low heat until you get the desired texture.</li>
    </ol>
