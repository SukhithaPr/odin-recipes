            heated, add the onion and saute until softened. Add the ginger and garlic and saute for a few seconds. Do
            not let them burn.</li>
        <li>Add all the vegetables (except for the carrots) and a generous pinch of salt and stir-fry for a few minutes.
            Add the chicken, cayenne pepper and the curry sauce and stir-fry until the vegetables are just starting to
            soften. If you don’t have leftover curry sauce, then add the ingredients for the curry spices given in the
            recipe.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots and mix them in. Whisk the eggs together in a bowl, and season with a pinch of salt. Create
            a well in the middle of the vegetable mix and add the eggs into this well. Let the eggs cook while
            scrambling them. When the eggs are almost cooked, you can mix it with the vegetables and chicken. Taste and
            season with salt.</li>
