    <p>String Hoppers or Idiyaapam is a common SriLankan Breakfast staple just like Pittu and Hoppers. It is made using
        either steamed Wheat Flour or Roasted Rice Flour dough that is pressed through the mould to
        form thin thread like noodles that is woven in circles ideally over mini wicker mats and then steamed to
        perfection. </p>
    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One Packet of Roasted Rice Flour</li>
        <li>(preferred brand)please read the packet for more details and instructions</li>
        <li>Boiling water as required</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Wooden Spoon</li>
        <li>String Hopper Mould</li>
        <li>String Hopper Mats</li>
        <li>Steamer : You could even use your Rice Cooker for this</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure the flour is sifted well before using and everything is ready because this has to happen quickly.
        </li>
        <li>The boiling water does not have to be piping hot and steaming,let the steam go down a bit.</li>
        <li>Place the sifted rice flour in a bowl and keep the boiling water also right there.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour the hot water into the flour and keep stirring quickly using a wooden spoon and make into a
            firm but not “too hard” dough.Use your fingers and gather the dough to make a smooth one.</li>
        <li>Do not let this dough dry out.</li>
        <li>start the making as soon as the dough is ready.</li>
        <li>Remember to oil the string hopper mats to avoid them from sticking to the mat itself.Comes off easily if you
            oil them at least for the first batch.</li>
    </ol>
